# About 
â€œShuttle Service" is a pioneering pilot program conceived to transform campus transportation, elevating the commuting experience for students. This initiative is intricately designed to optimize evening shuttle services through the integration of modern technology and data-driven solutions. The overarching goal is to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of campus transportation, setting new standards for student mobility. Campus Shuttle Connect introduces a user-friendly mobile application, empowering students to seamlessly request rides from campus to their residences. The app interfaces with a centralized server, ensuring secure identification verification by cross-referencing Student UID (SUID) against an authorized student database. The success of this pilot program holds the potential to influence the university to invest in a larger, more comprehensive transportation solution.
